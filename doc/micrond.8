.SH NAME
micrond \- a minimal cron implementation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmicrond\fR\
 [\fB\-fhs\fR]\
 [\fB\-F \fIFAC\fR]\
 [\fB\-g \fR[\fBno\fR]\fIGROUP\fR[\fB=\fIDIR\fR]]\
 [\fB\-l \fIPRI\fR]\
 [\fB\-m \fIMAILER\fR]\
 [\fB\-p \fIDEV\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Micrond executes commands periodically as directed by one or more
\fIcrontabs\fR.  Each crontab is a plain text file, where each
non-empty line contains a formal schedule and a command that must be
run according to that schedule (a \fIcron job\fR).  System crontabs
also supply the name of the user on whose behalf the command must be
run.  Per-user crontabs lack this field, since the commands in them
are always executed on behalf of the user who owns the crontab.
.PP
Normally, a cron jobs is not run if its previous instance is still
running.  So that if a cron job that is run each minutes takes three
minutes to finish, it will be actually run once in three minutes.
However, maximum number of cron job instances that can be run
simultaneously can be configured in crontab.
.PP
Any output the running job produces on its standard output and
standard error is captured.  Upon termination, it is mailed to the
owner of the job.  The message \fBFrom\fR header is set to the cron
job owner name.  Its \fBSubject\fR contains the owner login name,
hostname of the server where the command was run and the command
itself, in the following format: ``Cron <\fIUSER\fR@\fIHOST\fR>
\fICOMMAND\fR''.  A copy of execution environment is included in
the message in form of additional \fBX-Cron-Env\fR headers, each
containing a single environment variable.
.PP
The recipient of the message can be altered by setting the \fBMAILTO\fR
variable in the crontab.
.PP
The mail is sent using ``/usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t''.  The
administrator can supply alternative mailer command via the \fB\-m\fR
command line option.
.PP
Instead of mailing job outputs, \fBmicrond\fR can be configured to
send them to a particular syslog facility.  If so configured, the
output is logged synchronously with the job execution.  The syslog
configuration can be global, using the \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-F\fR command
line options, per-crontab or even per-job, using the
\fBSYSLOG_FACILITY\fR variable setting.
.PP
On GNU/Linux systems, \fBmicrond\fR uses
.BR inotify(7)
to track crontab modifications.  On such systems a crontab is re-read
as soon as it is written to disk.
.PP
On other systems, \fBmicrond\fR checks crontab mtimes each minute and
re-reads the crontabs for which its value has changed.
.PP
.SS Crontab groups
There are four collections of crontabs, called \fIcrongroups\fR for
brevity.
.TP
.B Master crontab
A single crontab named \fB/etc/crontab\fR.  It is owned by root.  Only
root has write permissions.
.br
Each active line in this crontab consists of seven fields: first five
fields provide a schedule, the sixth field is the login name on the
user on whose behalf to run the command, and the rest of line is the
command to run. 
.TP
.B System crongroup
The system crongroup comprises crontabs located in the
\fB/etc/cron.d\fR directory.  They have the same format, ownership and
mode as the master crontab.  The purpose of this crongroup is to
facilitate packaging, so that each software package may provide its own
crontab and install it to a well-known location.
.TP
.B User crongroup
Contains personal crontabs of system users.  Located in
\fB/var/spool/cron/crontabs\fR directory, each crontab is owned by
the corresponding user and only its owner has read and write
permissions.
.br
Crontabs in this group don't have the username field.  The commands in
them are always executed on behalf of the crontab owner.
.TP
.B User group crongroup
Similarly to the user crongroup, it contains individual crontabs of
system users.  However, each user can have multiple crontabs.
Crontabs are located in subdirectories of
\fB/var/spool/cron/crongroups\fR named after each particular user.
Crontabs have the same format as per-user crontabs (no username
field).  The owner of the user group can delegate the permission to
create crontabs in it to another users by adding them to his primary
system group.
.br
This group is designed mainly for pseudo-users, such
as .e.g. \fIhttpd\fR or \fIbind\fR, to enable another users to execute
commands on behalf of them.  This is useful, for example, on servers
that host multiple websites.
.br
This group is experimental and its use must be explicitly enabled
using the \fB\-g\fR option upon \fBmicrond\fR startup.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-f
Remain in foreground.
.TP
\fB\-F \fIFAC\fR
Log output from cronjobs to this facility (implies \fB\-s\fR).
Default is \fBcron\fR.
.TP
.B \-h
Display a short help summary and exit.
.TP
\fB\-g \fIGROUP\fB=\fIDIR\fR
Define the directory or file name for crontab group \fIGROUP\fR.
Valid \fIGROUP\fR names are:
.BR master ,
.BR system ,
.BR user ,
and
.BR group .
.TP
\fB\-g \fR[\fBno\fR]\fIGROUP\fR
Enable or disable crontab group \fIGROUP\fR.  Note, that the
\fBgroup\fR crontab group is disabled by default.
.TP
\fB\-l \fIPRI\fR
Log only messages with syslog priority \fIPRI\fR or higher.  Valid
arguments in order of increasing priority:
.BR debug ,
.BR info , 
.BR notice ,
.BR warning ,
.BR err ,  
.BR crit , 
.BR alert ,
.BR emerg .
.TP
\fB\-m \fIMAILER\fR
Set mailer command.  Default is ``/usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t''.
.TP
\fB\-p \fISOCKET\fR
Send messages to syslog via this socket.  \fISOCKET\fR is either an
absolute file name of a UNIX socket, or a host name or IPv4 address
optionally followed by a colon and port number or service name.
.TP
.B \-s
Log output from cronjobs to syslog.  By default, the \fBcron\fR
facility is used.  Use \fB\-F\fR to change it.
